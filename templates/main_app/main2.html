          <p>
            <h5>Symptoms:</h5>
            <li>Bright orange spotting on expanded leaflets of oil palm.</li>
            <li>In young fronds, the spots are interveinal, vary in shapes and the size is about 2-3 mm long.</li>
            <li>In older fronds, the spots coalesced into larger spot.</li>
            <li>OS palm generally stunted, bronze and orange colored from a distance, bear smaller or no bunches and presences as isolated palms.</li>
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            <h5>Causal agents:</h5>
            <li>Coconut cadang-cadang viroid, the smallest pathogen known.</li>
            <li>Presence in several variants.</li>
            <li>All variants are infectious and the 256 variant was found frequently in the field.</li>
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            <h5>Disease management and controls:</h5>
            <li>Elimination of infected tree.</li>

          <h5 class="features__header">Charcoal Rot disease</h5>
          <p>
            <h5>Symptoms:</h5>
            <li>Symptoms are initially seen on the oldest fronds which become a yellowish colored and die.</li>
            <li>The stem base is affected by a black, dry rot which is extremely hard and extends as a band of necrotic tissues across the entire base.</li>
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            <h5>Causal agents:</h5>
            <li><i>Ustulina deusta</i>, originally known as <i>U. zonata</i>.</li>
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            <h5>Disease management and controls:</h5>
            <li>By the time the foliar symptoms are visible, the internally structure already severe that treatment is impossible.</li>
            <li>Sanitation is required to remove the disease palms.</li>

          <h5 class="features__header">Bunch Rot disease</h5>
          <p>
            <h5>Symptoms:</h5>
            <li>During the early stages of infection, strands of mycelium can be seen spreading over the bunch surface.</li>
            <li>Mycelium development is particularly profuse at the back of the bunch, against the base of the subtending frond where conditions are very moist.</li>
            <li>In the later stage, the mycelium grows over the fruit surface and penetrates the mesocarp.</li>
          </p>
          <br>

            <h5>Causal agents:</h5>

          <p>
            <h5>Disease management and controls:</h5>
            <li>Sanitation and maintenance of an adequate level of pollination.</li>
            <li>Prophylactic sprays of fungicides such as copper fungicides (i.e. copper oxide and Bordeaux mixture) or thiram can be carried out as a preventative control are also recommended.</li>

        <!-- Disease 4 -->
        <div class="features__feature" style="border: 3px solid black; padding: 30px;">
          <h5 class="features__header">Stem Wet Rot disease</h5>
          <p>
            <h5>Symptoms:</h5>
            <li>The first symptom is usually the sudden and simultaneous death of all unexpanded spear leaves, and the youngest expanded fronds surrounding the spears. 
            </li>
            <li>This is followed by the appearance of a dull yellowish discoloration in the remaining fronds, which then rapidly wither and die, until the whole crown has been killed. </li>
            <li>When the trunk is split, the internal tissues have been almost completely destroyed. </li>
            <li>The disease is typified by a wet, putrid rot which is brown, yellow or greyish in colour, and has a very objectionable smell.</li>
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            <h5>Causal agents:</h5>
            <li>There is no proven pathogen causing the disease, however, the type of rot found in the stem suggests that a bacterium is involved. </li>
            <li>A number of commonly-rotting fungi have been isolated from diseased tissues but these are very unlikely to be primary pathogens, although possibly accelerating tissue destruction.</li>
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            <h5>Disease management and controls:</h5>
            <li>Improve drainage to reduce high water-table.</li>
            <li>Infected palm should be excavated and disposed of in the interrow to prevent their colonization by potentially pathogenic fungi.</li>

        <div class="features__feature" style="border: 3px solid black; padding: 30px;">
          <h5 class="features__header">Sooty Mold disease</h5>
          <p>
            <h5>Symptoms:</h5>
            <li>Dark threadlike growth (mycelium) of the fungi resembling a layer of soot that grows on plants and other surfaces covered by dark black mycelium on the upper surface or lower side of the oil palm leaves.</li>
            <li>Attacks leaf of old frond oil palm. </li>
            <li>The fungi do not infiltrate into leaf tissue or causing physical damage. </li>
            <li>Unlike true fungal diseases, sooty mold is easily wiped from the leaf surface.</li>
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            <h5>Causal agents:</h5>
            <li>Several pathogens of the oil palm sooty mold are identified as <i>Meliola elaeidis</i> (Afrika); <i>Brooksia tropicalis</i> (Africa, Sabah, PNG); <i>Ceramothyrium</i> sp. (Sabah) and <i>Capnodium</i> sp. (Thailand).
            </li>
            <li>The disease can be spread through spores released by the fungus through wind, rainwater or vectors such as koya, aphid, mealybug, scale or whitefly.
            </li>
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            <h5>Disease management and controls:</h5>
            <li>The infected oil palm leaves should be removed and prune to prevent them from spreading to other healthy leaves. </li>
            <li>Adequate ventilation and sunlight in the field should be emphasized so that it reaches all parts of the palm leaves.</li>

        <!-- Disease 6 -->
        <div class="features__feature" style="border: 3px solid black; padding: 30px;">
          <h5 class="features__header">Algae Leaf Spot disease</h5>
          <p>
            <h5>Symptoms:</h5>
            <li>The presence of algae of various colors on the upper surface of the leaves of old fronds. </li>
            <li>Usually, the color of the colony is a brownish red that grows in patches and will eventually coalesce into larger patches. </li>
            <li>The shape of the colony is round and sometimes grows elongated. </li>
            <li>When these colonies are scraped, no damage occurs to the leaves, but the color of the leaves turns a pale green. </li>
            <li>This color change is due to the obstruction of algal colonies that do not allow sunlight to reach the leaf surface.</li>
            <li>The disease attacks mature palm trees, especially in plantation areas near roadside or dusty areas. </li>
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            <h5>Causal agents:</h5>
            <li><i>Cephaleuros</i> sp. algae and colonies of <i>Phycopeltis</i> sp. based on recent study in Perak, Johor and Terengganu.</li>
            <li>The disease spread through spores released by algae, either through wind or rainwater. </li>
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            <h5>Disease management and controls:</h5>
            <li>Removes the infected palm leaves to avoid infection to healthy trees. </li>
            <li>Adequate ventilation and sunlight on the farm.</li>
